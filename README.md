# Ultralesson API Automation Workshop with Rest Assured

Welcome to the API Automation Workshop's main branch, which features a fully integrated API automation framework using Rest Assured. This framework is the culmination of a step-by-step instructional journey designed to teach you the ins and outs of API testing, from basic concepts to advanced CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions.

## Framework Overview

The `main` branch contains the complete, production-ready API automation framework. It's an aggregate of all the incremental features and lessons introduced in the workshop's task branches. If you're looking to understand the full picture or just want to dive into the code, you're in the right place!

For those interested in learning how this framework was built piece by piece, we've organized the workshop into detailed steps, each corresponding to a specific branch. You can explore these branches to see the evolution of the framework and understand the implementation of each feature.

## Workshop Structure

Each branch represents a critical step in building the API automation framework. Below is an overview of what each branch covers:

_Teaches handling of comprehensive API responses, including deserialization strategies for status codes and headers._

### [6-add-to-cart-test-case](https://github.com/Ultralesson/api-automation-workshop/tree/6-add-to-cart-test-case)
_Covers a practical test scenario by implementing an "add to cart" feature, simulating real-world e-commerce user behavior._

### [7-api-endpoint-and-data-externalizing-in-rest-assured-tests](https://github.com/Ultralesson/api-automation-workshop/tree/7-api-endpoint-and-data-externalizing-in-rest-assured-tests)
_Provides insights into managing various environments and datasets by externalizing API endpoints and test data._

### [8-enhancing-test-reporting-mechanism](https://github.com/Ultralesson/api-automation-workshop/tree/8-enhancing-test-reporting-mechanism)
_Focuses on the importance of test reporting, discussing methods to enhance the visibility and analysis of test results._

### [9-setting-up-github-actions-for-automated-test-execution](https://github.com/Ultralesson/api-automation-workshop/tree/9-setting-up-github-actions-for-automated-test-execution)
_Completes the framework by integrating GitHub Actions for CI/CD, ensuring tests are automatically run with every code change._
